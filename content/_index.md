Hey there! I'm a software engineer with a knack for graphics programming. I absolutely love diving into the world of graphics and game engines, and occasionally
the world of embedded systems. I enjoy crafting shaders or optimizing rendering pipelines as a past-time. I share some of my thoughts here, feel free to connect!
